"""
Venue adapters — the boundary between shared logic and exchange specifics.

Two bots grew up separately and diverged in the parts that protect capital:
the crypto bot has an order journal, startup reconciliation, atomic state and a
risk engine; the stock bot had none of them. That divergence was not a design
decision, it was drift, and it is invisible until an order is lost or a state
file is corrupted mid-write.

Almost nothing about safety is venue-specific. Position accounting, stops,
risk limits, reconciliation and graduation are identical whether the thing
being traded is SOL or SPY. What genuinely differs is small:

  - how an order is submitted
  - how the response reports fills, fees and status
  - what the fee actually is
  - whether the market is open

Everything else is shared. A new venue means a new adapter here, not a new bot.

Per-asset variation stays where it already works: the coin/ticker -> profile ->
base resolution in .env. That is deliberately unconstrained, because volatility
and liquidity genuinely differ per asset. What must NOT vary per asset is the
safety machinery, which is why it lives above this boundary rather than inside
each bot.
