"""
Pre-register an experiment before running it.

Nearly every wrong conclusion this project has reached came from deciding what
counted as success after seeing the results: a grid searched over thirty
parameter pairs with the winner reported on the same data it was chosen from; a
timeframe switched because a number looked better, without first checking
whether the new setting could produce the outcome being sought; "we just need
more data" applied to a question the data could never answer.

The fix is not more discipline in the moment — it is writing the criteria down
first and making them awkward to change afterwards.

A registration records the hypothesis, the exact configuration, the start date,
the stopping rule and the success criteria, then hashes them. Results are
attached later and the hash is rechecked. If the terms moved between
registration and conclusion, the report says so instead of quietly grading
against the new terms.

This cannot prevent anyone editing a JSON file. It is meant to make doing so a
deliberate act that leaves a trace, which is enough — the failure it addresses
is drift, not fraud.
